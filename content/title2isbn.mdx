**#WSO2 #Ballerina #Microservices #Integration #API**

Every developer has a list of small "helper" services they plan to build but never get around to. For my Ebook Reader application, one of those was a service to find a book's ISBN. The data was scattered ‚Äî some in my database, some on public APIs. I needed a single, fast way to get it.

But I never had the momentum.

That changed when I saw the **‚ÄúWSO2 Real-World Integration Challenge‚Äù**.

It wasn‚Äôt just a reason to finally build the service. It gave me a deadline, a community, and the promise of a **WSO2 T-shirt** for finishing.

## üîß The Challenge That Made It Happen

The *WSO2 Real-World Integration Challenge* was a community event pushing developers to use a WSO2 product to solve a practical integration problem and share their story.

The steps were simple:
1. Build with a **WSO2 Product** (I chose Ballerina)
2. Write a blog/video about it
3. Share it with the community
4. Redeem cool swag

The barrier to entry was low, which was the exact push I needed to get started.

## üìñ Introducing: *Title2ISBN Service*

A **Ballerina-based microservice** that acts as a smart caching layer. When my Ebook Reader app needs an ISBN for a book title, it asks this service. The service checks its own cache (an Appwrite database) and only calls the external Open Library API if it's a new book.

### Core Features

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Caching logic to reduce latency
- üìû Fetches data from external REST APIs
- üíæ Persists new data to an Appwrite DB
- üì¶ Provides a single, clean REST endpoint
- üìä Includes comprehensive logging

It‚Äôs a simple, focused microservice that solves one problem really well ‚Äî thanks to Ballerina.

## ü§ñ How WSO2 Ballerina Helped

I was new to Ballerina, but setup was quick. The real magic happened in the VS Code extension.

The **Ballerina Visualizer** was incredibly useful. It automatically generated a sequence diagram of my code *as I was writing it*. I didn't have to draw anything. I could literally see my logic:

1.  Request comes into the service.
2.  A branch appears: `if book in cache?`
3.  The "Yes" path goes straight to the final response.
4.  The "No" path shows the call to the Open Library API, then another call to the Appwrite API to save the result, and *then* the final response.

Seeing this visual flow confirmed my logic was sound and made debugging much easier. The language itself, with its `record` types for handling JSON and its straightforward `http:Client`, made the networking code feel clean and safe.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **REST API Layer** | Exposes the `/isbn` endpoint to the main application. |
| **Caching Logic** | The core `if/else` block that decides to query the cache or fetch externally. |
| **Appwrite Connector** | The HTTP client code responsible for talking to the Appwrite database. |
| **External API Connector** | The HTTP client code for fetching data from the Open Library API. |
| **Data Models** | `record` types in Ballerina that define the shape of our data for type-safety. |

The service is designed to be a small, independent part of my larger Ebook Reader application ecosystem.

## üöß Known Issues

- Only queries one external data source (Open Library) for now
- Error handling is basic
- No price comparison or other metadata is fetched yet
- Needs proper deployment setup

But that's okay. The primary goal was to build a working, efficient caching service.

---

## üìà What‚Äôs Next?

**Short-Term:**
- Add Google Books as a fallback data source
- Refine error handling and response codes

**Long-Term:**
- Containerize the service with Docker
- Deploy to a cloud platform like **WSO2 Choreo**
- Build another Ballerina service for price comparison

## üéÅ Final Thoughts & Swag

If you have a nagging integration problem you've been putting off, I highly recommend trying out Ballerina. The language and its tooling gave me the momentum to finally build this service.

Ballerina didn't just help me write code; it helped me *visualize* it.

Check out the repo: [GitHub ‚Äì Walapalam/title2isbn-service](https://github.com/Walapalam/title2isbn-service)
Fork it, watch it, or try running the build.
