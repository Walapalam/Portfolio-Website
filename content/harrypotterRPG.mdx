# Building a Hogwarts-Inspired Text RPG with Amazon Q CLI: A Developer's Journey

**#AmazonQCLI #AWSBuilders #GameDev #Python #RPG**

---

Like many developers, I keep a running backlog of passion projects I never seem to have time for. One of them has always been a text-based RPG set in a magical universe — something that captures the charm, challenge, and imagination of a fantasy world, but lives entirely in the terminal. I had the concept, the storyline fragments, even rough spell ideas — but it sat untouched.

That changed the moment I saw the **“Build Games with Amazon Q CLI”** campaign announcement.

This wasn't just an opportunity to dust off the idea. It was a challenge, a deadline, and a community-driven initiative wrapped into one. And, of course, the irresistible allure of redeeming an **Amazon Q branded T-shirt** if I completed the journey.

## 🔧 The Campaign That Kickstarted It All

Running from **May 20 to June 20, 2025**, the *Amazon Q CLI Game Challenge* encourages builders across Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China to build a game using Amazon Q CLI — an AI-powered developer tool from AWS — and share their experience through a blog or video post.

The process:
1. Build a game using **Amazon Q CLI**
2. Document your experience (blog/video)
3. Share it on social media with `#AmazonQCLI`
4. Redeem your swag

The low barrier to entry and clear structure gave me exactly the push I needed.

## 🧙 Introducing: *Hogwarts RPG – A Magical Text Adventure*

Inspired by the wizarding world, *Hogwarts RPG* is a **Python-based, command-line text RPG**. You begin as a first-year student entering the legendary school of witchcraft and wizardry. From getting sorted into your house to learning spells and dueling classmates, it brings the magical journey to life through text, imagination, and AI-assisted coding.

### Core Gameplay Features

- 🎓 Interactive sorting hat quiz  
- 📖 Spell learning and progression system  
- ⚔️ Turn-based wizard duels  
- 🏰 Castle exploration with randomized events  
- 💾 JSON-based save/load system  
- 🧠 House-specific buffs and strategic combat

It’s early, a bit rough around the edges, and still very much in **Phase 1** (CLI-first MVP), but the foundation is now laid — thanks to Amazon Q CLI.

## 🤖 How Amazon Q CLI Helped Build This

I’d never used Amazon Q CLI before. Installing it was straightforward, and getting it running on my local Python environment took less than 30 minutes.

Once in the chat-based interface, I simply started describing the components I wanted:

> *"Help me build a character system that supports four houses with different stats."*  
> *"Create a spellcasting mechanic where spells cost mana and apply status effects."*  
> *"Implement a save/load system using JSON serialization."*

The responses were intelligent, context-aware, and modular. Q CLI not only generated code, but explained **why** it structured components the way it did. This made integration and debugging significantly easier.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The game is structured around a simple OOP design:

| Module        | Purpose                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`     | Game loop and menu navigation             |
| `player.py`   | Character class and house-based traits    |
| `spell.py`    | Spell definitions and casting logic       |
| `npcs.py`     | Opponents for duels                       |
| `utils.py`    | Randomized event generation and helpers   |
| `save.json`   | Persistent player data                    |

With Q CLI’s help, each module was built to be self-contained yet extensible — allowing for rapid iteration and future feature expansion.

## 🚧 Current Limitations

Let’s be clear — this isn’t finished. Not by a long shot.

- Bugs exist in the dueling system under edge cases  
- No questline or narrative yet  
- Inventory and potion systems are absent  
- Spell balancing needs tuning  
- It’s still a CLI interface  

But this was never about perfection. It was about **starting**, iterating fast, and building *with* AI, not *instead of* the developer.

---

## 📈 What’s Next?

### Short-Term Roadmap:
- Polish combat logic and status effects
- Add branching story mode using JSON logic
- Introduce potion crafting

### Long-Term Vision:
- GUI version via `pygame` or `Tkinter`
- Cloud-based save system (DynamoDB or S3)
- Optional multiplayer duels over local network or REST API

## 🎁 Final Thoughts & T-Shirt Redemption

If you’re in **Asia Pacific, Japan, or Greater China**, and you’ve got a half-baked idea sitting around — dust it off. The campaign gave me the right nudge and tools to execute on an old idea.

Amazon Q CLI took my rough concept and gave it structure — line by line, prompt by prompt.

You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Walapalam/hogwarts-rpg-cli) (still in progress). Feel free to fork, contribute, or just follow along.
