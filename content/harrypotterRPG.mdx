# Building a Hogwarts-Inspired Text RPG with Amazon Q CLI: A Developer's Journey

**#AmazonQCLI #AWSBuilders #GameDev #Python #RPG**

Like many developers, I keep a backlog of passion projects I never seem to finish. One of them has always been a text-based RPG set in a magical universe — a fantasy world built entirely in the terminal.

I had storylines, mechanics, spell ideas — but no momentum.

That changed with the **“Build Games with Amazon Q CLI”** campaign.

It wasn’t just a chance to revisit the idea. It added a deadline, community accountability — and a promise of an **Amazon Q T-shirt** if I finished.

---

## 🔧 The Campaign That Kickstarted It All

Running from **May 20 to June 20, 2025**, the *Amazon Q CLI Game Challenge* pushed devs across Asia Pacific, Japan, and Greater China to build a game using Amazon Q CLI — an AI tool from AWS — and share their journey.

Steps:
1. Build with **Amazon Q CLI**
2. Write a blog/video
3. Share with `#AmazonQCLI`
4. Redeem swag

The barrier to entry was low. That was the spark I needed.

## 🧙 Introducing: *Hogwarts RPG – A Magical Text Adventure*

A **Python-based, command-line RPG** where you’re a first-year student at Hogwarts. You get sorted, learn spells, duel peers — all through text and logic-driven design.

### Core Gameplay Features

- 🎓 Sorting Hat quiz  
- 📖 Spell learning & progression  
- ⚔️ Turn-based duels  
- 🏰 Castle exploration with events  
- 💾 JSON save/load system  
- 🧠 House-based stat buffs

It’s still early, still CLI-only, but the structure exists — thanks to Q CLI.

## 🤖 How Amazon Q CLI Helped

I’d never touched Q CLI before. Install was smooth. Setup in Python took under 30 minutes.

The real magic: the AI chat interface. I prompted:

```jsx
"Create a character system for four Hogwarts houses with different stats."
"Build a spell system with mana cost and status effects."
"Implement JSON-based save/load."
```

Q CLI delivered contextual, modular code — and explained its decisions. Debugging and integration were fast.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

| Module      | Purpose                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| `main.py`   | Game loop and menu navigation        |
| `player.py` | Character traits and house bonuses   |
| `spell.py`  | Spells and combat mechanics          |
| `npcs.py`   | Dueling opponents                    |
| `utils.py`  | Random event generator               |
| `save.json` | Player data store                    |

Each file is standalone, modular, and ready for iteration.

## 🚧 Known Issues

- Dueling system bugs in edge cases  
- No narrative or questline  
- No inventory/potion system  
- Spells need balancing  
- CLI-only for now  

But that’s fine. The goal was momentum, not perfection.

---

## 📈 What’s Next?

**Short-Term:**
- Refine combat and effects  
- Add story logic (JSON-based)  
- Introduce potion crafting  

**Long-Term:**
- GUI (maybe `pygame`, `Tkinter`)  
- Cloud saves (S3 or DynamoDB)  
- Multiplayer (REST API or sockets)

## 🎁 Final Thoughts & Swag

If you’re in **APAC, Japan, or China**, and have an old idea sitting around — pick it up. The campaign gave me the accountability and toolset to bring something to life.

Amazon Q CLI didn’t do the work for me. It did it *with* me.

Check out the repo: [GitHub – Walapalam/hogwarts-rpg-cli](https://github.com/Walapalam/hogwarts-rpg-cli)  
Fork it, watch it, or try the build.
